# Setup

## Required Gemini CLI Version

To install this extension, the Gemini CLI version must be v0.6.0 or above. The version can be found by running: `gemini --version`.

## Looker MCP Server

This section covers connecting to a Looker instance.

1.  **Verify Environment Variables**: Before attempting to connect, confirm with the user that the following environment variables are set in the extension configuration or their shell environment.

    *   `LOOKER_BASE_URL`: The base URL of your Looker instance.
    *   `LOOKER_CLIENT_ID`: The Looker API client ID.
    *   `LOOKER_CLIENT_SECRET`: The Looker API client secret.
    *   `LOOKER_VERIFY_SSL`: (Optional) Whether to verify SSL certificates. Defaults to `true`.
    *   `LOOKER_PROJECT`: The Google Cloud Project ID to use when accessing the Conversational Analytics API.
    *   `LOOKER_LOCATION`: The Google Cloud Location ID to use when accessing the Conversational Analytics API.

2.  **Handle Missing Variables**: If a command fails with an error message containing a placeholder like `${LOOKER_BASE_URL}`, it signifies a missing environment variable. Inform the user which variable is missing and instruct them to set it.

3.  **Handle Permission Errors**: If you encounter permission errors, ensure the user has the correct permissions in Looker to perform the requested actions.

## Information for Asking Questions

1.  **Models**: Looker will have one or more data models defined. You will need
    to use the `get_models` tool to find the proper model. You can also display
    the list of models to the user and ask them for the proper model to use.
2.  **Explores**: A Looker model will contain one or more explores. Explores
    describe a set of prejoined database tables to answer questions about a
    particular topic area.
3.  **Ask Data Insights**: This tool will be used to send the question to the
    API. It requires an array of 1 to 5 model and explore combinations.
